                        <h3>REFLECTION B</h3>
                        <p>One of the most valuable things I have learned during Modules 1-3 is how to effectively gather and analyze requirements. It may seem basic, but this step shapes the entire project. Through this process, I’ve realized how crucial it is to understand what stakeholders really need and turn those insights into clear system requirements. This lesson became even more apparent while working on SmartHome Plus Automation, where I had to balance the needs of tech-savvy users with those who had little experience with smart home systems. This challenge helped me design a system that was not only functional but also user-friendly and adaptable to different levels of expertise.

                            The concepts and tools from these modules have had a real impact on my projects, both at work and personally. Using the ideas from Module 2, I built a modular, scalable system that could handle high traffic without slowing down, making inventory tracking much smoother.
                            
                            The UX design and usability testing techniques from Module 3 have also been incredibly useful. By creating user personas and wireframes, I was able to get a deeper understanding of the users' needs. Through usability testing, I identified pain points in navigation and reworked parts of the app to improve user interaction. What stood out the most in this module was how much empathy plays a role in UX design. Understanding the users' perspectives allowed me to create a more intuitive and satisfying experience for them.
                            
                            A big challenge I faced was during the requirement analysis phase of the CareCrest patient management system. Different stakeholders had conflicting needs, which made it difficult to create a clear set of requirements. To address this, I turned to methods from Module 1, like stakeholder prioritization and requirements workshops. These tools helped us find common ground and focus on the most critical features, leaving the "nice-to-have" elements for later consideration.
                            
                            Another hurdle was setting up the event-driven architecture for SmartHome Plus using AWS services. At first, I had trouble configuring Lambda and IoT Core to handle all the device communications smoothly. But after revisiting the material in Module 2 and seeking advice from colleagues with more experience in cloud infrastructure, I was able to get things running efficiently. This process deepened my understanding of how to create scalable, event-driven systems.
                            
                            I have made significant progress in designing scalable system architectures. Before these modules, I mainly worked on smaller, simpler systems, but now I feel comfortable working with microservices and event-driven architectures. This has made my work more flexible and future-proof, particularly for projects like FitRideX Connect, where real-time data processing and user interaction are critical.
                            
                            However, I still see areas for growth, especially in user experience (UX) design. While Ihave applied many of the foundational concepts, I want to dive deeper into accessibility design and inclusive design. Making systems more accessible for users with disabilities is an area I haven't fully explored yet, but it’s something I’m excited to learn more about.
                            The topics covered in Modules 1-3—from gathering requirements to designing system architecture and improving user experience—are all deeply connected. Understanding how to gather detailed requirements ensures that the system architecture is built to support the right features and interactions. The principles of modularity and scalability that I learned in system architecture design directly influence how well the system performs during usability testing. If the architecture isn't flexible or scalable enough, the user experience can suffer, especially when the system is under load.
                            
                            Usability testing also loops back to the requirements phase. Testing often reveals new insights or features that should have been considered from the beginning, making the design process more iterative. This continuous feedback loop between user testing, requirements gathering, and system design has taught me to think holistically about projects, ensuring that every phase informs the next.
                            
                            Overall, these modules have significantly shaped my growth as an application system designer. I now approach projects with a more comprehensive perspective, balancing technical architecture and user experience. I’m better equipped to apply the right tools and strategies to ensure that the systems I design are scalable, high-performing, and user-friendly. Going forward, I’m excited to explore new areas like accessibility while continuing to refine the skills I’ve learned so far.

                        <h3>REFLECTION C</h3>
                        <p>The most impactful lessons from Modules 4-6 revolved around optimizing system performance and improving security and privacy. While working on the activities, I saw how crucial it is to design with scalability in mind. Applying techniques like load balancing and horizontal scaling was a game changer. Another valuable experience was implementing strong security frameworks for SmartHome Plus, a household automation application. Ensuring data compliance with regulations and adding secure authentication mechanisms was eye-opening and helped me understand the balance between security and functionality.

                            Performance optimization techniques from Module 4 improved real-time data processing for SmartHome Plus, reducing latency and enhancing user experience. Security lessons from Module 5 were crucial for SmartHome Plus, where I implemented encryption and regular audits to protect user data. Usability testing methods from Module 6 refined my group project’s interface, improving user satisfaction by addressing pain points in navigation.
                            
                            A major challenge was balancing performance with security for SmartHome Plus. Initially, prioritizing speed left gaps in security, but I adapted by adding secure protocols without sacrificing performance. Another challenge was managing stakeholder concerns about workflow disruption during SmartHome Plus system updates. I used prioritization techniques to ease the transition and gain stakeholder buy-in.
                            
                            My biggest growth came from designing scalable, secure systems, particularly with SmartHome Plus, where I integrated AWS services to improve performance and security. I've also grown in UX design, shifting from technical solutions to focusing on user needs and accessibility, which has greatly improved system usability.
                            
                            Modules 4-6 expanded on earlier lessons, particularly in integrating performance and privacy concerns early in the design process. I now see security and maintenance as ongoing processes, not just one-time tasks. Regular audits and updates, as practiced in MedNet360, have shown me how to keep systems resilient over time.
                            
                            For SmartHome Plus, the integration plan will focus on using AWS IoT Core and Lambda to handle communication between devices, with microservices architecture for scalability. Adaptation strategies include ensuring compatibility with third-party devices (e.g., Google Assistant) through open standards like MQTT.
                            
                            To optimize performance, caching and asynchronous tasks will be handled through AWS Lambda and SQS, while security will rely on encryption and multi-factor authentication. A maintenance plan will include regular performance checks, security updates, and user feedback to keep the system efficient and secure over time.
                            In summary, Modules 4-6 strengthened my ability to design scalable, secure systems and improved my focus on user experience, which will continue to influence my future work.

                        <h3>REFLECTION D</h3>
                        <p>Reflecting on Modules 7-8, I found the most valuable aspect to be the in-depth exploration of ethical considerations in application system design. Understanding how design decisions can influence user privacy, security, and trust really expanded my perspective. This was particularly relevant to projects I’ve been working on, such as SmartScoop and TeleCareConnect, where managing sensitive health data is a priority. These modules helped me recognize the long-term implications of design choices, making it clear that ethical considerations need to be at the forefront, not just technical efficiency.


                            One of the key takeaways for me was learning how to craft comprehensive ethical guidelines for system design. I’ve been able to apply these principles in our group project SmartHome Plus, where I focused on embedding transparency and user consent into the user experience. For instance, I ensured that users were clearly informed about data collection and usage, especially in sensitive areas like telemedicine. The results were quite positive — user engagement increased, and feedback showed that users felt more secure and confident in the platform’s handling of their data. This underscored for me the importance of not just meeting functional requirements, but also ensuring users feel their privacy is respected.
                            
                            
                            The tools and frameworks from these modules have also been practical in my work, particularly during usability testing for SmartHome Plus. Ethical considerations like accessibility and respecting user autonomy were built into the testing process. We designed the app to accommodate a wide range of user needs, and the feedback from participants was encouraging. Users found the app intuitive and appreciated the transparency in how their data was handled. This feedback not only improved the user experience but also reinforced the value of incorporating ethical principles early in the design process.
                            
                            
                            That said, balancing the needs of different stakeholders has been one of the more challenging aspects. These ethical dilemmas can be difficult to navigate, as there often isn’t a perfect solution. To address these challenges, I consulted established guidelines like the Australian Privacy Act and sought advice from Professor Earnest Foo. This experience taught me that ethical design is an ongoing process that involves continuous communication and compromise to ensure all perspectives are considered.
                            
                            
                            
                            In terms of personal growth, I’ve seen substantial development in my ability to integrate ethical thinking into technical decisions, particularly regarding privacy and security. Feedback from my peers and professor Earnest Foo has reinforced this. In our group project, for instance, I proposed implementing an audit log to track access to patient records, which was well-received. It added a level of transparency and accountability that aligns with ethical best practices, and this approach was recognized as forward-thinking during project reviews.
                            
                            
                            The skills and insights from these modules have significantly advanced my overall learning. I now view system architecture through a more ethical lens, understanding that each technical decision has broader implications for user trust and system integrity. This has been a major shift in how I approach my work. One of the main lessons I’ve learned is that the user experience is deeply intertwined with ethics — creating systems that are transparent, fair, and secure not only builds trust but also leads to better long-term user engagement.
                            
                            
                            Looking ahead, I believe integrating emerging technologies, like edge computing, could further enhance projects like SmartHome Plus. By processing data closer to the user’s home, edge computing can reduce privacy concerns associated with cloud-based processing, while also improving the system’s responsiveness. This innovation offers an exciting opportunity to balance technological efficiency with stronger privacy protections, and I plan to explore it further in future designs.
                            In conclusion, Modules 7-8 have provided me with critical insights into the ethical dimensions of system design. I’ve grown in both my technical abilities and ethical judgment, and these lessons will undoubtedly shape how I approach future projects. By combining technical innovation with ethical responsibility, I believe it’s possible to design systems that are not only efficient but also fair, secure, and trustworthy.
